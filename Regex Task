1) You must validate phone numbers using Regular Expressions (Regex).

A phone number is VALID only if it matches one of these formats:

1. 1234567890
2. (123) 456-7890
3. 123-456-7890
4. 91 (123) 456-7890

Your program will receive multiple phone numbers as inputs.

You must:

 ✔ Count how many inputs are valid

 ✔ Count how many inputs are invalid

 ✔ Print both counts

  HOW OUTPUT MUST LOOK


Valid phone numbers: X
Invalid phone numbers: Y


Where X = number of valid numbers
and Y = number of invalid numbers
