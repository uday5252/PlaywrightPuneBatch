 ⭐ 1. Introduction to SCRUM

SCRUM is an Agile framework used to develop software in small iterations called Sprints (1–4 weeks).
It focuses on:
✔ teamwork
✔ customer feedback
✔ small increments
✔ continuous improvement


 ⭐ Analogy (Best One)

Scrum is like building a house room-by-room.
You don’t wait until the entire building is completed.
Instead:

 build a room
 show it to owner
 get feedback
 improve
 then build next room

 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Swiggy adds small features every 2 weeks:

 Week 1: Add coupons section
 Week 3: Add voice ordering
 Week 5: Improve delivery ETA accuracy

That is Scrum happening in the background.


 ⭐ 2. Scrum Roles and Responsibilities

Scrum has 3 major roles:

 ⭐ 1. Product Owner (PO)

 ✔ Responsibilities

 Owns the product vision
 Writes user stories
 Manages Product Backlog
 Prioritizes features
 Represents the customer

 ⭐ Analogy

PO = film director
He decides:

 what the movie should look like
 which scenes are important
 what should be shot first


 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Zomato PO decides:

 Add "Zomato Gold" feature first
 Improve order tracking later
 Remove unwanted features


 ⭐ 2. Scrum Master (SM)

 ✔ Responsibilities

 Removes impediments(problems)
 Coaches team in Agile
 Facilitates meetings (Scrum events)
 Shields team from outside pressure



 ⭐ Analogy

Scrum Master = Traffic police
He does not drive the car.
He ensures smooth flow, removes blockages.



 ⭐ Real-Time Example

If Jenkins is down during build, SM arranges DevOps support.


 ⭐ 3. Development Team

 ✔ Responsibilities

 Design
 Code
 Test
 Deploy
 Deliver working software every sprint

 ⭐ Analogy

Construction workers building the house.

 ⭐ Real-Time Example

A team of 6:

 3 developers
 2 testers
 1 designer

Deliver a working module every 2 weeks.

 ⭐ 3. Scrum Core Practices and Artifacts

Below are all Scrum events, artifacts, and practices with analogy and real examples.

 ⭐ A. User Story

A user story describes a requirement from the user’s point of view.

Format:
As a <user> I want <feature> so that <benefit>

 ⭐ Analogy

Like a customer saying to a tailor:
“As a groom, I want a perfectly fitted suit so I look good at my wedding.”

 ⭐ Real-Time Example

As a user, I want to search food by cuisine so I can find nearby restaurant options.

(Swiggy story)

 ⭐ B. Sprint

A Sprint is a time-boxed iteration, usually 2 weeks, where the team builds a working feature.

 ⭐ Analogy

A school timetable
You have 2 weeks to complete a chapter → then review → then start next chapter.

 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Sprint 1 (week 1–2): Add “Add to Cart”
Sprint 2: Add “Checkout”
Sprint 3: Add “Payment Gateway”

 ⭐ C. Release Planning Meeting

This meeting decides when a set of features will be released.

 ⭐ Analogy

Planning a wedding timeline:

 Invitations by 15th
 Decoration by 20th
 Catering by 24th


 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Zomato decides:

 Release new UI by January
 Add voice ordering by March
 Add table booking by June

 ⭐ D. Sprint Planning Meeting

Held at the start of each sprint to decide:

 What to build (PO + team)
 How to build (team)

 ⭐ Analogy

Before cooking biryani →
You check ingredients, assign tasks, decide time.



 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Team takes 25 story points worth of work for the next 2-week sprint.





 ⭐ E. Daily Scrum Meeting (Daily Stand-up)

A 15-minute meeting where each member answers:

1. What I did yesterday
2. What I’ll do today
3. Any blockers?



 ⭐ Analogy

Morning school assembly → each student gives daily updates.



 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Dev: “I completed login API.”
QA: “I will test it today.”
Blocker: “DB access is pending.”

Scrum Master resolves it.


 ⭐ F. Sprint Review Meeting

At the end of the sprint →
Team demo the working software to PO and stakeholders.



 ⭐ Analogy

Like showing a room to the owner after building it.



 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Team shows:
✔ working cart
✔ working checkout
✔ working search

PO gives feedback: “Improve UI alignment.”


 ⭐ G. Retrospective

Meeting after Sprint Review
Discuss:

 What went well?
 What didn’t?
 What to improve next?


 ⭐ Analogy

After a cricket match, players discuss mistakes and improvements.


 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Team identifies:

 Delays due to unclear stories
 Plan to refine backlog better next sprint


 ⭐ I. Sprint Backlog

The subset of Product Backlog items selected for the sprint.


 ⭐ J. Burn-Down Chart

Shows:

 work remaining vs. time

Used to track sprint progress.


 ⭐ Analogy

Like a countdown chart before exam → remaining chapters vs. days left.

 ⭐ Real-Time Example

If team planned 30 story points
Day 5: 20 points remaining
Day 10: 0 points
→ Good progress shown in burn-down.

 ⭐ K. Velocity

Velocity = How many story points the team completes every sprint.



 ⭐ Analogy

Speed of a car → 60 km/h
Similarly → team speed = 25 story points/sprint



 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Sprint 1 → 18 points
Sprint 2 → 22 points
Sprint 3 → 20 points
= Velocity around 20

Used for planning next sprints.


 ⭐ 1. Definition of “Done” (DoD)

 ✔ Definition

The Definition of Done is a clear checklist that tells the team when a user story or task is truly completed.

It removes confusion like:

 “Is development done?”
 “Has testing finished?”
 “Shall we move it to Done column?”

 ⭐ Analogy

Submitting an assignment in college.
You consider it "Done" only when:

 You write the assignment
 Proofread it
 Add references
 Get it printed
 Submit it

Only then it is truly DONE.

 ⭐ Real-Time Example (Software)

For a user story “As a user, I want to reset my password”, DoD could be:

 Code written
 Code review done
 QA tested
 No critical bugs

Only after all items are done → story is “Done”.

 ⭐ 2. Splitting User Story into Task

 ✔ Definition

Breaking a user story into smaller actionable tasks that developers and testers can work on.

 ⭐ Analogy

User story = “Cook a biryani.”
Tasks:

 Buy ingredients
 Chop vegetables
 Marinate chicken
 Cook rice
 Fry onions
 Mix and steam

You cannot give the whole story to one person; tasks make it manageable.

 ⭐ Real-Time Example

User Story: “User should be able to log in.”
Tasks:

 Design login UI
 Create backend API
 Implement validation
 Create database table
 Write unit tests
 Testing & bug fixing

 ⭐ 3. Why Split a User Story into Tasks?

 ⭐ Reasons:

✔ Easier to estimate
✔ Easier to assign work
✔ Break complexity



 ⭐ Analogy

Breaking down exam syllabus into chapters makes studying easier.



 ⭐ Real-Time Example

If a login story is not split:
“Who is doing what?” becomes confusing.

When split:

 Dev1 does backend
 Dev2 does UI
 Tester prepares test cases
  Clearly organized.


 ⭐ 4. Guidelines for Breaking Down a User Story into Tasks

 ✔ 1. Each task must be 1 day or less

If > 1 day → break it further.

 ✔ 2. Tasks should be technology-based, not requirement-based

Example:
❌ “Create login feature”
✔ “Create login API”



 ⭐ Analogy

Packing for a vacation:
Instead of writing “Pack luggage,” break into:

 Pack clothes
 Pack toiletries
 Pack shoes
 Pack documents



 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Story: “Upload profile picture”
Tasks:

 UI for file upload
 API for uploading
 AWS S3 integration
 Add validation
 Testing





 ⭐ 5. Examples of Scrum Task Board

Text version of task board:

```
-
|       To Do        |      In Progress   |    Done    |
-
| UI Design          |                    |            |
| Backend API        | Coding API         | Unit Tests |
| DB Setup           |                    |            |
| Write Test Cases   |                    |            |
-
```

 ⭐ Analogy

It is like a school timetable board, showing:

 Subjects to study
 Subjects you are currently studying
 Subjects completed

 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Jira board for login story:

 To Do → “Write test cases”
 In Progress → “Build login API”
 Done → “Validation complete”


 ⭐ 6. Planning Poker®

 ✔ Definition

Planning Poker® is a game-like estimation technique used to estimate user stories in story points.

Everyone picks cards → discuss → agree on final estimate.

 ⭐ Analogy

Like friends guessing the bill amount at a restaurant before the bill arrives.
Everyone gives a number, discuss why, and agree on one amount.



 ⭐ Real-Time Example

For story “Add product to cart”:
Dev1: 5 points
Dev2: 3 points
Tester: 5 points
Architect: 8 points

Discussion happens → Final = 5 points.


 ⭐ 7. Planning Poker® - Process/Steps

 ✔ Step-by-step:

1. Product Owner reads the user story
2. Team asks questions for clarity
3. Each member secretly chooses a card (Fibonacci numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…)
4. Everyone reveals at the same time
5. Highest and lowest explain their reasoning
6. Final estimate is decided

 ⭐ Analogy

Like everyone secretly voting for class monitor, then revealing votes together.

 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Story: “Add search suggestions in shopping app”

 Dev1 chooses 8 (complex API logic)
 Dev2 chooses 3 (simple UI)
 Tester chooses 5 (moderate testing)

After discussion, final = 5 points.


 ⭐ 8. What Are Story Points?

 ✔ Definition

Story Points measure:

 Complexity
 Effort
 Uncertainty

NOT time like hours or days.

 ⭐ Analogy

Story points are like distance (km), not time.
Traveling 10 km could take:

 10 mins (bike)
 30 mins (car)
 1 hour (walk)

Distance stays same → time varies.

 ⭐ Real-Time Example

Login story = 3 points
Add-to-cart = 5 points
Checkout with payment = 13 points (big and complex)


 ⭐ 9. How Do We Estimate in Story Points?

We use:
✔ Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21…)
Bigger numbers represent higher complexity.

The team compares stories relatively.

 ⭐ Analogy

Estimating story points is like:
“Which bag is heavier?”
You compare bags, not measure exact weight.

 ⭐ Real-Time Example

If:

 Login = 3
 File upload seems double complex → 5
 Payment integration seems huge → 13

Team creates a relative scale.


 ⭐ 10. What Goes into Story Points?

Story Points include:

 ✔ 1. Complexity

How complex the logic is
Ex: Payment gateway = high complexity

 ✔ 2. Effort

How much work is needed
Ex: Uploading files requires more backend work

 ✔ 3. Uncertainty / Risks

Unknown things → increase points
Ex: Third-party API integration

 ✔ 4. Dependencies

More people involved → more points

 ⭐ Analogy

Planning a trip includes:
✔ Distance
✔ Road conditions
✔ Traffic
✔ Weather
✔ Vehicle condition

All together determine the travel effort.

 ⭐ Real-Time Example:

Story: “Integrate Razorpay payment gateway”

 Complex logic
 External API
 Security checks
 Many components involved

Hence → 13 or 21 story points
