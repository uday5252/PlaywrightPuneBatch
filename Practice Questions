1) You are given an array of numbers

You must:

  Step 1: Check if the array is a palindrome

A palindrome means:

 First element = Last element
 Second element = Second last
 And so on…

You must check this using the two-pointer method:

 `left` pointer starts at index 0
 `right` pointer starts at last index
 Compare both
 Move inward

❌ You are not allowed to reverse the array.

---

  🔹 What Should You Return?

  CASE 1: If the array IS a palindrome

👉 Return the sum of all elements.

  CASE 2: If the array is NOT a palindrome

👉 Return the index (0-based) of the first mismatch from the left.

Meaning:
The first time `arr[left] != arr[right]`, return `left`.

---

  🔹 INPUT–OUTPUT EXAMPLES

  Example 1 (Palindrome)

Input:

```
[3, 5, 7, 5, 3]
```

Check:

```
3 == 3 
5 == 5 
7 middle 
```

Palindrome 

Sum = 3+5+7+5+3 = 23

Output:

```
23
```

---

  Example 2 (Not Palindrome — mismatch at index 0)

Input:

```
[2, 4, 6, 4, 9]
```

Check:

```
index 0 vs index 4 → 2 vs 9 ❌ mismatch
```

First mismatch at index 0

Output:

```
0
```

---

  Example 3 (Not Palindrome — mismatch later)

Input:

```
[4, 2, 6, 3, 4]
```

Check:

```
(0,4): 4 vs 4  match
(1,3): 2 vs 3 ❌ mismatch
```

First mismatch at index 1

Output:

```
1
```

---

  Example 4 (Even-length palindrome)

Input:

```
[8, 9, 9, 8]
```

Check:

```
8 == 8 
9 == 9 
```

Palindrome 
Sum = 8 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 34

Output:

```
34
```

---

  Example 5 (Single element)

Input:

```
[10]
```

A single element is always a palindrome 
Sum = 10

Output:

```
10
```

==============================================
2) You are given a paragraph of text, and your job is to count how many words follow a specific pattern called CVC:

  CVC = Consonant – Vowel – Consonant

That means:

 The word has 3 letters
 1st letter = Consonant
 2nd letter = Vowel
 3rd letter = Consonant

Example of CVC words:

```
cat → c (consonant), a (vowel), t (consonant)
pen → p, e, n
dog → d, o, g
```

Not CVC:

```
tea → t (consonant), e (vowel), a (vowel) ❌ ends with vowel
ice → i (vowel) ❌ starts with vowel
ship → 4 letters ❌
```

---

  🔹 What Counts as Vowels?

The question says:

```
Vowels are: a, e, i, o, u (case-insensitive)
```

So uppercase also counts:

```
A, E, I, O, U 
```

Everything else (letters A–Z except vowels) = consonants

---

  🔹 Rules for a Valid CVC Word

 Must be exactly 3 letters
 Must start with a consonant
 Must have a vowel in the middle
 Must end with a consonant
 Can be lowercase or uppercase
❌ No numbers, no symbols, no longer words

---

  🔹 What You Must Do

Write a program that:

 Reads a paragraph
 Finds all words that match the CVC pattern
 Counts how many of them exist
 Use regular expressions (regex)

So the output is a number → the count.

---

  🔹 Example

 Input:

```
The cat sat on the big red bat.
```

Words: the, cat, sat, on, the, big, red, bat

CVC words:

 cat 
 sat 
 big 
 red 
 bat 

Count = 5

 Output:

```
5
```

---
===================================================================================================
3) You are given a sorted array (numbers are in increasing order).
Some numbers are repeated (duplicates).

To save space, we want to remove duplicates and keep only one copy of each number.

Since the array is sorted, all duplicates will be next to each other — this makes it easier.

 🎯 Task:

Write a program that returns the count of unique elements after removing duplicates.

👉 Important:
We need to return only the count, NOT the modified array.

  Requirement:

Use the Two-Pointer Approach.

---

  Example 1

 📥 Input:

```
[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```

 🔍 Unique elements are:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

 📤 Output:

```
4
```

Because there are 4 unique numbers.

---

  Example 2

 📥 Input:

```
[5, 5, 5, 5]
```

 🔍 Unique elements:

```
[5]
```

 📤 Output:

```
1
```

Only one unique number.

---

  Example 3

 📥 Input:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

(No duplicates)

 📤 Output:

```
4
```

All are unique.

---

  Example 4

 📥 Input:

```
[]
```

 📤 Output:

```
0
```

No elements → no unique numbers.

---

  What is the Two-Pointer Approach?

We use:

 Pointer i → Tracks position of unique elements
 Pointer j → Scans through the array

Whenever `arr[j]` is different from `arr[i]`, it means we found a new unique number.

So we move `i` forward and increase our unique count.

 Final unique count = `i + 1`
====================================================================================
4) Reverse Only Words with Even Length

  What You are Given:

A sentence with multiple words separated by spaces.

  What You Must Do:

 Check each word.
 If the word length is even → reverse the word.
 If the word length is odd → keep it as it is.
 Keep all spaces and word positions EXACTLY the same.

  Restrictions:

❌ No loops (no `for`, `while`)
❌ No regex
 You can only use:

 `.trim()`
 `.split(" ")`
 `.map(...)`
 `.join(" ")`
 `.length`

  Output:

Return the final transformed sentence.

---

  SIMPLE LOGIC (Step-by-Step)

1️⃣ Split the sentence into words.
2️⃣ For each word:

 If `word.length % 2 == 0` → reverse it.
 Else → keep it unchanged.
  3️⃣ Join the words back into a sentence.

---

  INPUT & OUTPUT EXAMPLES

  Example 1

Input:

```
"Hello world"
```

Word lengths:

 Hello → 5 (odd) → keep
 world → 5 (odd) → keep

Output:

```
"Hello world"
```

 No changes.

---

  Example 2

Input:

```
"Hi John Doe"
```

Words:

 Hi → 2 (even) → reverse → "iH"
 John → 4 (even) → reverse → "nhoJ"
 Doe → 3 (odd) → keep

Output:

```
"iH nhoJ Doe"
```

---

  Example 3

Input:

```
"Time to code"
```

Words:

 Time → 4 (even) → "emiT"
 to → 2 (even) → "ot"
 code → 4 (even) → "edoc"

Output:

```
"emiT ot edoc"
```

---

  Example 4 (spaces must stay same!)

Input:

```
"Play  and fun"
```

Words:

 Play → 4 (even) → "yalP"
 and → 3 (odd) → keep
 fun → 3 (odd) → keep

Output:

```
"yalP  and fun"
```

==============================================================================
5) Match Dates in DD/MM/YYYY or DD-MM-YYYY Format

Question:
Write a regex that finds all valid dates in a text where the date is:

 Day: 01 to 31
 Month: 01 to 12
 Year: 1900–2099
 Separator can be `/` or `-`

Example Input:

```
The events are on 05/11/2024, 31-12-2023, and 45/10/2021.
```

Expected Matches:

```
05/11/2024
31-12-2023
```

(45/10/2021 should NOT match because 45 is not a valid day.)

---

6) Extract Hashtags (Only Valid Words)

Question:
Write a regex to extract all valid hashtags from a social media post.

Rules:

 Must start with ``
 Followed by only letters, numbers, or underscores
 At least 2 characters total (e.g., `a` ❌)

Example Input:

```
Loving the JavaScript_2025 course! fun !wow 123
```

Expected Matches:

```
JavaScript_2025
fun
```

(`!wow` and `123` should NOT match because `123` has no letter.)

---

7) Match Words That Start and End With the Same Letter

Question:
Write a regex to find all words where:

 First and last character are the same (case-insensitive)
 Minimum length = 2

Example Input:

```
Wow level noon dad cat pop Apple
```

Expected Matches:

```
Wow
level
noon
dad
pop
```

(`cat` and `Apple` don’t match.)
