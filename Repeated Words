Question

Find Consecutively Repeated Words (Chat Repetition Detector)

You are given a line of chat text.
Your task is to detect words that appear twice in a row, i.e., consecutively repeated words.

 Requirements:

* Matching should be case-insensitive
  (e.g., `Hello hello` is a repetition)
* Each repeated word should appear in the output only once
* Output them in the order they first appear
* If no repeated words exist, output an empty list.
